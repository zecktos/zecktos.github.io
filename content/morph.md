# morph

*video // animation // processing* 

morph is an project by the theater and performance collective [neus künstler theater](https://www.neueskuenstlertheater.de/).
i made for this project a 50 minute long animation of pixels populating the canvas.
this was done with the "processing" framework.
morph was shown the first time at “radar ost festival 2020” at deutsches theater berlin. more infos [here](https://www.deutschestheater.de/en/programme/a-z/morph/).
neues künstler theater also made a second video with my animation. you can watch it [here](https://www.neueskuenstlertheater.de/kopie-von-morph).
