# soap - resurrection

*theater // video // python* 

"s.o.a.p – resurrection"  was the final episode of a trashy scifi  theater series called s.o.a.p (“seventh east german space patrol”).
it was live streamed on youtube in november 2020. in this projekt i was directing, made the videos, as well as the projection mapping. 
additionally i build a little python program for interaction between the audience and the actors.
the youtube live chat was fetched and displayed on to the scenery and whenever someone typed “lol” into the chat a big flashy “lol” was seen on stage
